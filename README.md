# Text Compression with Huffman Coding (Next.js App)

This project is a web application built with **Next.js** that allows users to **compress** and **decompress** `.txt` files using **Huffman Coding** — a well-known lossless data compression algorithm.  
You can upload a `.txt` file to get a compressed `.huf` file (smaller in size), and later, you can upload the `.huf` file to retrieve the original `.txt` file without any data loss.

---

## Features
- Upload a `.txt` file and compress it into a `.huf` file.
- Upload a `.huf` file to decode it back into the original `.txt`.
- Lossless compression — no data is lost during encoding or decoding.
- Simple, clean, and fast UI built with Next.js.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16 or higher recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   Using npm:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the development server:**

## Usage

### Encoding (Compress)
- Go to the "Encode" section/page.
- Upload a `.txt` file from your device.
- The app will process it and provide a `.huf` file for download.
- This `.huf` file will be smaller in size compared to the original `.txt`.

### Decoding (Decompress)
- Go to the "Decode" section/page.
- Upload the `.huf` file generated by the app.
- You will get back the original `.txt` file with **zero data loss**.

## Future Improvements
- Support multiple file formats (.pdf, .docx, etc.).
- Show compression ratio and file size comparisons.
- Add drag-and-drop file upload feature.
